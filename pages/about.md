## Soma Eastside Church exists...

As a family of families obeying Jesus' command to make disciples who make disciples.  Our vision is that every man, woman, and child on the Eastside would hear the good news of Jesus and see the love of Jesus lived out by their neighbors.

## Our Identities

- **Family** - we are children of God who live and care for each other as a family. (Genesis 12:1-3, John 1:12-13, Romans 12:10-16)

- **Missionaries** - we are sent by God to restore all things to himself (John 1:14, 20-21, Colossians 1:19, 2Corinthians 5:17-21)

- **Servants** - we are servants of God who serve others as a way of life (Matthew 20:25-28, John 13:1-17, Philippians 2:5-11)

## Our Core Values

- **The Gospel**: the gospel ("good news") of Jesus changes how we live.  When Jesus saves us, He changes our lives.

- **New Creations**: believers should put aside our old lives and let God conform our lives to His will by changing how we think and live.

- **God's Family**: we personally care for the needs of one another - both physically and spiritually.

- **Missionaries and Servants**: we show people outside the church who Jesus is by loving them, serving them, and sharing the gospel with those who do not know Jesus.

- **Make Disciples**: we support church plants locally and around the world who are spreading the good news of Jesus.

## Ministry

- We meet throughout the week in Missional Communities.  Following Jesus is done every day, not only on Sunday mornings.

- Sunday morning gatherings to celebrate what God has done, connect with our church family, and equip ourselves to live out the gospel.

- Youth ministry (middle school and high school) to equip the youth on the Eastside to follow Jesus and live out their faith

- Build strong families through Soma Kids ministry and gospel-centered parenting resources
